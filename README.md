![UML Diagram](doc/uml.png)

1. In our UML diagram, should Task be a class or should it simply be a string?  Why or why not?
   The task should be a class. Right now you are not doing anything else except listing the task name and assigning it to
   a project so it is okay if it is just a string. But, in the future, you want to assing multiple people to a task or have a task record its own progress.
   This would cause you to have to make it into a class of its own. 
1. What future enhancements might you add to this project next?  Does the answer to this question change your answer to the first question?
   In the future we might add something that allows the task to hold information about itself so that the user can
   have certain questions answered. For example, the task could keep track of its progress and have its progress updated by whoever is supposed to
   perform the task. We would also want the user to have the ability to assign multiple people to a task and then be able to keep track of who is working
   on what. It might work similar to github projects. At least that is the view we currently have on the program.
   This would keep our answer to the first question the same. We would want it as a class just in case we add some future funtions
   that the task would be able to perform.
